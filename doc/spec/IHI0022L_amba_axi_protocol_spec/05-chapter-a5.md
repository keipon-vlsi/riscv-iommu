# **Transaction identifiers and ordering**

This chapter describes transaction identifiers and how they can be used to control the ordering of transactions. It contains the following sections:

- [A5.1](#page-89-0) *[Transaction identifiers](#page-89-0)*
- [A5.2](#page-90-0) *[Unique ID indicator](#page-90-0)*
- [A5.3](#page-92-0) *[Request ordering](#page-92-0)*
- [A5.4](#page-98-0) *[Interconnect use of transaction identifiers](#page-98-0)*
- [A5.5](#page-99-0) *[Write data and response ordering](#page-99-0)*
- [A5.6](#page-100-0) *[Read data ordering](#page-100-0)*

# <span id="page-89-0"></span>**A5.1 Transaction identifiers**

The AXI protocol includes a transaction identifier (AXI ID). A Manager can use the AXI ID to identify transactions that must be returned in order.

All transactions with a given AXI ID value must remain ordered, but there is no restriction on the ordering of transactions with different ID values. A single physical port can support out-of-order transactions by acting as several logical ports, each handling its transactions in order.

By using AXI IDs, a Manager can issue transactions without waiting for earlier transactions to complete. This can improve system performance because it enables parallel processing of transactions.

# <span id="page-89-1"></span>**A5.1.1 Transaction ID signals**

The read and write request, read data, and write response channels include a transaction ID signal.

**Table A5.1: ID signals**

<span id="page-89-4"></span><span id="page-89-3"></span>

| Name | Width      | Default   | Description                                                      |
|------|------------|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| AWID | ID_W_WIDTH | All zeros | Transaction identifier used for the ordering of write requests.  |
| BID  | ID_W_WIDTH | All zeros | Transaction identifier used for the ordering of write responses. |
| ARID | ID_R_WIDTH | All zeros | Transaction identifier used for the ordering of read requests.   |
| RID  | ID_R_WIDTH | All zeros | Transaction identifier used for the ordering of read data.       |

<span id="page-89-6"></span><span id="page-89-5"></span><span id="page-89-2"></span>The ID width properties are described in [Table](#page-89-2) [A5.2.](#page-89-2)

**Table A5.2: ID width properties**

| Name       | Values | Default | Description                                                     |
|------------|--------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| ID_W_WIDTH | 032    | -       | ID width on write channels in bits, applies to AWID and<br>BID. |
| ID_R_WIDTH | 032    | -       | ID width on read channels in bits, applies to ARID and<br>RID.  |

If a width property is zero, the associated signal is not present.

A Manager that does not support reordering of its requests and responses, or has only one outstanding transaction, can omit the ID signals from its interface. An attached Subordinate must have its AxID inputs tied LOW.

A Subordinate that does not reorder requests or responses does not need to use ID values.

If a Subordinate does not include ID signals, it cannot be connected to a Manager that does have ID signals, because the Manager requires BID and RID to be reflected from AWID and ARID.

# <span id="page-90-5"></span><span id="page-90-0"></span>**A5.2 Unique ID indicator**

The unique ID indicator is an optional flag that indicates when a request on the read or write address channels is using an AXI identifier that is unique for in-flight transactions. A corresponding signal is also on the read and write response channels to indicate that a transaction is using a unique ID.

The unique ID indicator can be used downstream of the AXI Manager to determine when a request needs to be ordered with respect to other requests from that Manager. Requests that do not require ordering might not require tracking in downstream components.

The Unique\_ID\_Support property is used to indicate whether an interface supports unique ID indication.

**Table A5.3: Unique\_ID\_Support property**

| Unique_ID_Support | Default | Description                                                      |
|-------------------|---------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| True              |         | Unique ID indicator signals are present on<br>the interface.     |
| False             | Y       | Unique ID indicator signals are not present<br>on the interface. |

When Unique\_ID\_Support is True, the following signals are included on the read request, read data, write request, and write response channels.

**Table A5.4: Unique ID indicator signals**

<span id="page-90-4"></span><span id="page-90-3"></span><span id="page-90-2"></span><span id="page-90-1"></span>

| Name                                      | Width | Default | Description                                                        |
|-------------------------------------------|-------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| AWIDUNQ,<br>BIDUNQ,<br>ARIDUNQ,<br>RIDUNQ | 1     | 0b0     | If asserted high, the ID for this transfer is<br>unique-in-flight. |

The following rules apply to the unique ID indicators:

- When AWIDUNQ is asserted, there must be no outstanding write transactions from this Manager with the same AWID value.
- A Manager must not issue a write request with the same AWID as an outstanding write transaction that had AWIDUNQ asserted.
- If AWIDUNQ is deasserted for a request, the corresponding BIDUNQ signal must be deasserted in a single transfer response or the Completion part of a multi-transfer response.
- If AWIDUNQ is asserted for a request, the corresponding BIDUNQ signal must be asserted in a single transfer response or the Completion part of a multi-transfer response.
- When ARIDUNQ is asserted, there must be no outstanding read transactions from this Manager with the same ARID value.
- A Manager must not issue a read request with the same ARID as an outstanding read transaction that had ARIDUNQ asserted.
- If ARIDUNQ is deasserted for a request, the corresponding RIDUNQ signal must be deasserted for all response transfers for that transaction.
- If ARIDUNQ is asserted for a request, the corresponding RIDUNQ signal must be asserted for all response transfers for that transaction.

- For an Atomic transaction that includes read and write responses, additional rules apply:
  - If AWIDUNQ is deasserted for an Atomic request, the corresponding RIDUNQ signal must be deasserted for all response transfers for that transaction.
  - If AWIDUNQ is asserted for an Atomic request, the corresponding RIDUNQ signal must be asserted for all response transfers for that transaction.

A transaction is outstanding from the cycle that had AxVALID asserted until the cycle when the final response transfer is accepted by the Manager. If an interface includes BCOMP, the transaction is considered to be outstanding until a response is received with BCOMP asserted.

An Atomic transaction is outstanding until both write and read responses are accepted by the Manager, see [A6.4](#page-112-0) *[Atomic transactions](#page-112-0)*.

Some transaction types specify that AxIDUNQ is required to be asserted, if present. If not specified, asserting AxIDUNQ is optional, even if there are no outstanding transactions using the same ID.

# <span id="page-92-0"></span>**A5.3 Request ordering**

The AXI request ordering model is based on the use of the transaction identifier, which is signaled on ARID or AWID.

Transaction requests on the same channel, with the same ID and destination are guaranteed to remain in order.

Transaction responses with the same ID are returned in the same order as the requests were issued.

The ordering model does not give any ordering guarantees between:

- Transactions from different Managers
- Read and write transactions
- Transactions with different IDs
- Transactions to different Peripheral regions
- Transactions to different Memory locations

If a Manager requires ordering between transactions that have no ordering guarantee, the Manager must wait to receive a response to the first transaction before issuing the second transaction.

## <span id="page-92-1"></span>**A5.3.1 Memory locations and Peripheral regions**

The address map in AMBA is made up of Memory locations and Peripheral regions.

A Memory location has all of the following properties:

- A read of a byte from a Memory location returns the last value that was written to that byte location.
- A write to a byte of a Memory location updates the value at that location to a new value that is obtained by a subsequent read of that location.
- Reading or writing to a Memory location has no side-effects on any other Memory location.
- Observation guarantees for Memory are given for each location.
- The size of a Memory location is equal to the single-copy atomicity size for that component.

A Peripheral region has all of the following properties:

- A read from an address in a Peripheral region does not necessarily return the last value that was written to that address.
- A write to a byte address in a Peripheral region does not necessarily update the value at that address to a new value that is obtained by subsequent reads.
- Accessing an address within a Peripheral region might have side-effects on other addresses within that region.
- Observation guarantees for Peripherals are given per region.
- The size of a Peripheral region is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED but it must be contained within a single Subordinate component.

A transaction can be to one or more address locations. The locations are determined by AxADDR and any relevant qualifiers such as the address space.

- Ordering guarantees are given only between accesses to the same Memory location or Peripheral region.
- A transaction to a Peripheral region must be entirely contained within that region.
- A transaction that spans multiple Memory locations has multiple ordering guarantees.

### <span id="page-93-0"></span>**A5.3.2 Device and Normal requests**

Transactions can be either of type Device or Normal.

### *Device*

A read or write where the request has AxCACHE[1] deasserted.

Device transactions can be used to access Peripheral regions or Memory locations.

#### *Normal*

A read or write where the request has AxCACHE[1] asserted.

Normal transactions are used to access Memory locations and are not expected to be used to access Peripheral regions.

A Normal access to a Peripheral region must complete in a protocol compliant manner, but the result is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED.

## <span id="page-93-1"></span>**A5.3.3 Observation and completion definitions**

For accesses to Peripheral regions, a Device read or write access DRW1 is observed by a Device read or write access DRW2, when DRW1 arrives at the Subordinate component before DRW2.

For accesses to Memory locations, all of the following apply:

- A write W1 is observed by a write W2, if W2 takes effect after W1.
- A read R1 is observed by a write W2, if R1 returns data from a write W3, when W2 is after W3.
- A write W1 is observed by a read R2, if R2 returns data from either W1 or from write W3, when W3 is after W1.

Read R1 or write W1 can be of type Device or Normal.

The definitions of write and read completions are:

#### *Write completion response*

The cycle when the associated BRESP handshake is given, when BVALID, BREADY and BCOMP (if present) are asserted.

#### *Read completion response*

The cycle when the last associated RDATA handshake is given, when RVALID, RLAST and RREADY are asserted.

### <span id="page-93-2"></span>**A5.3.4 Manager ordering guarantees**

There are three types of ordering model guarantees:

- Observability guarantees before a completion response is received.
- Observability guarantees from a completion response.
- Response ordering guarantees.

### *Observability guarantees before a completion response is received*

All of the following guarantees apply to transactions from the same Manager using the same ID:

- A Device write DW1 is guaranteed to arrive at the destination before Device write DW2, where DW2 is issued after DW1 and to the same Peripheral region.
- A Device read DR1 is guaranteed to arrive at the destination before Device read DR2, where DR2 is issued after DR1 and to the same Peripheral region.

- A write W1 is guaranteed to be observed by a write W2, where W2 is issued after W1 and both have the same cacheability and Memory location.
- A write W1 that has been observed by a read R2 is guaranteed to be observed by a read R3, where R3 is issued after R2 and have the same cacheability and Memory location.

### *Observability guarantees from a completion response*

The guarantees from a completion response are as follows:

- For a read request, the completion response guarantees that it is observable to a subsequent read or write request from any Manager.
- For a Non-bufferable write request, the completion response guarantees that it is observable to a subsequent read or write request from any Manager.
- For a Bufferable write request, the completion response can be sent from an intermediate point. It does not guarantee that the write has completed at the endpoint but does guarantee observability, depending on the Domain of the request:
  - Non-shareable: observable to the issuing Manager only.
  - Shareable: observable to all other Managers in the Shareable Domain.
  - System: observable to all other Managers.

For more information on Domains, see [A8.3](#page-133-0) *[Cache coherency and Domains](#page-133-0)*.

#### *Response ordering guarantees*

Transaction responses have all the following ordering guarantees:

- A read R1 is guaranteed to receive a response before the response to a read R2, where R2 is issued from the same Manager after R1 with the same ID.
- A write W1 is guaranteed to receive a response before the response to a write W2, where W2 is issued from the same Manager after W1 with the same ID.

### <span id="page-94-0"></span>**A5.3.5 Subordinate ordering requirements**

To meet the Manager ordering guarantees, Subordinate interfaces must meet the following requirements.

### *Peripheral locations*

For Peripheral locations, the execution order of transactions to Peripheral locations is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED. This execution order is typically expected to match the arrival order but that is not a requirement.

### *Memory locations*

For transactions with the same cacheability and Memory location:

- A write W1 must be ordered before a write W2 with the same ID, where W2 is received after W1 is received.
- A write W1 must be ordered before a write W2, where W2 is received after the completion response for W1 is given.
- A write W1 must be ordered before a read R2, where R2 is received after the completion response for W1 is given.
- A read R1 must be ordered before a write W2, where W2 is received after the completion response for R1 is given.

#### *Response ordering requirements*

- The response to read R1 must be returned before the response to a read R2, where R2 is received after R1 with the same ID.
- The response to write W1 must be returned before the response to a write W2, where W2 is received after W1 with the same ID.

## <span id="page-95-0"></span>**A5.3.6 Interconnect ordering requirements**

An interconnect component has the following attributes:

- A request is received on one port and is either issued on a different port or responded to.
- A response is received on one port and is either issued on a different port or consumed.

When the interconnect issues requests or responses, it must adhere to the following requirements:

- A read R1 request must be issued before a read R2 request, where R2 is received after R1, with the same ID and to the same or overlapping locations.
- A write W1 request must be issued before a write W2 request, where W2 is received after W1, with the same ID, to the same or overlapping locations.
- A Device read DR1 request must be issued before a Device read DR2 request, where DR2 is received after DR1, with the same ID and to the same Peripheral region.
- A Device write DW1 request must be issued before a Device write DW2 request, where DW2 is received after DW1, with the same ID and to the same Peripheral region.
- A read R1 response must be issued before a read R2 response, where R2 is received after R1, with the same ID.
- A write W1 response must be issued before a write W2 response, where W2 is received after W1, with the same ID.

When the interconnect is acting as a Subordinate component, it must also adhere to the Subordinate requirements.

Any manipulation of the AXI ID values that are associated with a transaction must ensure that the ordering requirements of the original ID values are maintained.

### <span id="page-95-1"></span>**A5.3.7 Response before the endpoint**

To improve system performance, it is possible for an intermediate component to issue a response to some transactions. This action is known as an early response. The intermediate component issuing an early response must ensure that visibility and ordering guarantees are met.

### *Early read response*

For Normal read transactions, an intermediate component can respond with read data from a local memory if it is up to date with respect to all earlier writes to the same or overlapping address. In this case, the request is not required to propagate beyond the intermediate component.

An intermediate component must observe ID ordering rules, which means a read response can only be sent if all earlier reads with the same ID have already had a response.

### *Early write response*

For Bufferable write transactions (AWCACHE[0] is asserted), an intermediate component can send an early write response for transactions that have no downstream observers. If the intermediate component sends an early write response, the intermediate component can store a local copy of the data, but must propagate the transaction downstream, before discarding that data.

An intermediate component must observe ID ordering rules, which means a write response can only be sent if all earlier writes with the same ID have already had a response.

After sending an early write response, the component must be responsible for ordering and observability of that transaction until the write has been propagated downstream, and a write response is received. During the period between sending the early write response and receiving a response from downstream, the component must ensure that:

- If an early write response was given for a Normal transaction, all subsequent transactions to the same or overlapping Memory locations are ordered after the write that has had an early response.
- If an early write response was given for a Device transaction, then all subsequent transactions to the same Peripheral region are ordered after the write that has had an early response.

When giving an early write response for a Device Bufferable transaction, the intermediate component is expected to propagate the write transaction without dependency on other transactions. The intermediate component cannot wait for another read or write to arrive before propagating a previous Device write.

### <span id="page-96-3"></span><span id="page-96-0"></span>**A5.3.8 Ordering between requests with different memory types**

There are no ordering requirements between Cacheable requests and Device or Non-cacheable Normal requests. Responses must be in order for transactions with the same AXI ID, irrespective of cacheability.

Ordering requirements between Device and Normal Non-cacheable requests depends on the Device\_Normal\_Independence property.

**Table A5.5: Device\_Normal\_Independence property**

| Device_Normal_Independence | Default | Description                                                                                                                                |
|----------------------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| True                       |         | A Device request is permitted to overtake, or be overtaken by, a<br>Normal Non-cacheable request with the same ID to the same<br>location. |
| False                      | Y       | Device and Normal Non-cacheable requests with the same ID, to<br>the same location must be observed in issue order.                        |

Guidance for connecting Manager and Subordinate interfaces with different values of Device\_Normal\_Independence is shown in [Table](#page-96-2) [A5.6.](#page-96-2)

**Table A5.6: Device\_Normal\_Independence interoperability**

<span id="page-96-2"></span>

|                | Subordinate: False                                                               | Subordinate: True                                                                            |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Manager: False | Compatible.                                                                      | Incompatible.<br>The Subordinate might not meet the ordering<br>requirements of the Manager. |
| Manager: True  | Compatible.<br>The Subordinate might enforce stricter<br>ordering than required. | Compatible.                                                                                  |

### <span id="page-96-1"></span>**A5.3.9 Ordered write observation**

To improve compatibility with interface protocols that support a different ordering model, a Subordinate interface can give stronger ordering guarantees for write transactions, known as Ordered Write Observation.

The Ordered\_Write\_Observation property is used to define whether an interface has Ordered Write Observation.

**Table A5.7: Ordered\_Write\_Observation property**

| Ordered_Write_Observation | Default | Description                                               |  |
|---------------------------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------|--|
| True                      |         | The interface exhibits Ordered Write Observation.         |  |
| False                     | Y       | The interface does not exhibit Ordered Write Observation. |  |

An interface that exhibits Ordered Write Observation gives guarantees for write transactions that are not dependent on the destination or address:

• A write W1 is guaranteed to be observed by a write W2, where W2 is issued after W1, from the same Manager, with the same ID.

When using Ordered Write Observation, a Manager can issue multiple write requests without waiting for write responses, and they are observed in issue order. This can result in improved performance when using the Producer-Consumer ordering model.

# <span id="page-98-0"></span>**A5.4 Interconnect use of transaction identifiers**

When a Manager is connected to an interconnect, the interconnect appends additional bits to the AWID and ARID identifiers that are unique to that Manager port. This has two effects:

- Managers do not have to know what ID values are used by other Managers because the interconnect makes the ID values used by each Manager unique by appending the Manager number to the original identifier.
- The ID identifier at a Subordinate interface is wider than the ID identifier at a Manager interface.

For write responses, the interconnect uses the additional bits of the BID identifier to determine which Manager port the write response is destined for. The interconnect removes these bits of the BID identifier before passing the BID value to the correct Manager port.

For read data, the interconnect uses the additional bits of the RID identifier to determine which Manager port the read data is destined for. The interconnect removes these bits of the RID identifier before passing the RID value to the correct Manager port.

# <span id="page-99-0"></span>**A5.5 Write data and response ordering**

A Manager must issue write data in the same order that it issues the transaction requests.

When using credited transport, this rule applies to each Resource Plane. Therefore, it is permitted to send data out of order with respect to requests if they are using different Resource Planes. Interleaving data transfers for different transactions is permitted if they are on different Resource Planes. See [A2.4.2](#page-34-0) *[Resource Planes](#page-34-0)* for more information on Resource Planes.

[Figure](#page-99-1) [A5.1](#page-99-1) shows an example of write data ordering and interleaving when using two Resource Planes, it shows:

- Data for the transaction with ID1 is permitted to be issued before data for ID0 as they are using different RPs.
- <span id="page-99-1"></span>• Data transfers for ID1 can be interleaved between transfers for ID0 or ID2, as they are using different RPs.

![](_page_99_Figure_7.jpeg)

**Figure A5.1: Example of a write data ordering with two Resource Planes**

A Subordinate must ensure that the BID value of a write response matches the AWID value of the request to which it is responding.

<span id="page-99-2"></span>An interconnect must ensure that write responses from a sequence of transactions with the same AWID value targeting different Subordinates are received by the Manager in request order.

# <span id="page-100-0"></span>**A5.6 Read data ordering**

The Subordinate must ensure that the RID value of any returned data matches the ARID value of the request to which it is responding.

The interconnect must ensure that read data from a sequence of transactions with the same ARID value targeting different Subordinates are received by the Manager in request order.

The read data reordering depth is the maximum number of accepted requests for which a Subordinate might send read data. A Subordinate that sends read data in the same order as the requests were received has a read data reordering depth of one.

The read data reordering depth is a static value that can be specified by the designer of the Subordinate.

There is no mechanism for a Manager to dynamically determine the read data reordering depth of a Subordinate.

## <span id="page-100-1"></span>**A5.6.1 Read data interleaving**

AXI ordering permits read data transfers with different ID values to be interleaved. This applies to all transactions that can have multiple read data transfers, including Atomic transactions.

Some AXI Manager and interconnect components can be more efficiently designed if it is determined at design-time whether the attached Subordinate interface will interleave read data from different transactions.

The property Read\_Interleaving\_Disabled is used to indicate whether an interface supports the interleaving of read data transfers from different transactions.

**Table A5.8: Read\_Interleaving\_Disabled property**

| Read_Interleaving_Disabled | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                          |
|----------------------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| True                       |         | A Manager interface is not capable of receiving read data that is<br>interleaved.<br>A Subordinate interface is guaranteed not to interleave read data.                              |
| False                      | Y       | A Manager interface is capable of receiving read data that is<br>interleaved.<br>A Subordinate interface might interleave data from read<br>transactions with different ARID values. |

For some interfaces, this property can be used as a configuration control, for others it is a capability indicator. All Managers that issue transactions with different IDs must be designed to accept interleaved data. Managers might use the configuration option to disable interleaving as an optimization when the attached Subordinate supports the disabling of interleaving.

### <span id="page-101-0"></span>**A5.6.2 Read data chunking**

The read data chunking option enables a Subordinate interface to reorder read data within a transaction using a 128b granule. The start address might be used as a hint to determine which chunk to send first, but the Subordinate is permitted to return chunks of data in any order.

The property Read\_Data\_Chunking is used to indicate whether an interface supports the return of read data in reorderable chunks.

**Table A5.9: Read\_Data\_Chunking property**

| Read_Data_Chunking | Default | Description                                                              |
|--------------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| True               |         | Read data chunking is supported.                                         |
| False              | Y       | Read data chunking is not supported, no chunking signals are<br>present. |

## **A5.6.2.1 Read data chunking signaling**

When read data chunking is supported, the following signals as shown in Table [A5.10](#page-101-1) are added to the read request and data channel.

| ARCHUNKEN  | 1                | 0b0       | If asserted in a read request, the Subordinate can<br>send read data in 128b chunks.                                                                                                                                   |
| RCHUNKV    | 1                | 0b0       | Asserted high to indicate that RCHUNKNUM and<br>RCHUNKSTRB are valid. It must be the same for<br>every response of the transaction.                                                                                    |
| RCHUNKNUM  | RCHUNKNUM_WIDTH  | All zeros | Indicates the chunk number being transferred.<br>Chunks are numbered incrementally from zero,<br>according to the data width and base address of<br>the transaction.                                                   |
| RCHUNKSTRB | RCHUNKSTRB_WIDTH | All ones  | Indicates the read data chunks that are valid for<br>this transfer.<br>Each bit corresponds to 128 bits of data. The least<br>significant bit of RCHUNKSTRB corresponds to<br>the least significant 128 bits of RDATA. |

The RCHUNKNUM\_WIDTH property defines the width of the RCHUNKNUM signal.

**Table A5.11: RCHUNKNUM\_WIDTH property**

| Name            | Values           | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|-----------------|------------------|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| RCHUNKNUM_WIDTH | 0, 1, 5, 6, 7, 8 | 0       | Width of RCHUNKNUM in bits.<br>Must be 0 if Read_Data_Chunking == False else<br>0 or 1 if DATA_WIDTH < 128<br>8 if DATA_WIDTH == 128<br>7 if DATA_WIDTH == 256<br>6 if DATA_WIDTH == 512<br>5 if DATA_WIDTH == 1024 |

The RCHUNKSTRB\_WIDTH property defines the width of the RCHUNKSTRB signal.

**Table A5.12: RCHUNKSTRB\_WIDTH property**

| Name             | Values        | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                                |
|------------------|---------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| RCHUNKSTRB_WIDTH | 0, 1, 2, 4, 8 | 0       | Width of RCHUNKSTRB in bits.<br>Must be 0 if Read_Data_Chunking == False else<br>0 or 1 if DATA_WIDTH < 256<br>2 if DATA_WIDTH == 256<br>4 if DATA_WIDTH == 512<br>8 if DATA_WIDTH == 1024 |

Interfaces with a small DATA\_WIDTH can include RCHUNKNUM and RCHUNKSTRB signals as 1-bit wide or omit them from the interface. When using interface protection, the RCHUNKCHK signal covers both of these signals, so RCHUNKNUM and RCHUNKSTRB must be the same width for connected components.

It is recommended that RCHUNKNUM and RCHUNKSTRB are omitted if not required by the interface.

### **A5.6.2.2 Read data chunking protocol rules**

In the read data chunking protocol, all the following rules apply:

- ARCHUNKEN must only be asserted for transactions with the following attributes:
  - Size is equal to the data channel width, or Length is one transfer.
  - Size is 128 bits or larger.
  - Addr is aligned to 16 bytes.
  - Burst is INCR or WRAP.
  - Opcode is ReadNoSnoop, ReadOnce, ReadOnceCleanInvalid, or ReadOnceMakeInvalid.
- The ID value must be unique-in-flight, which means:
  - ARCHUNKEN can only be asserted if there are no outstanding read transactions using the same ARID value.
  - The Manager must not issue a request on the read channel with the same ARID as an outstanding request that had ARCHUNKEN asserted.
  - If present on the interface, ARIDUNQ must be asserted if ARCHUNKEN is asserted.
- If ARCHUNKEN is deasserted, RCHUNKV must be deasserted for all response transfers of the transaction.

- If ARCHUNKEN is asserted, RCHUNKV can be asserted for response transfers of the transaction.
- RCHUNKV must be the same for every response transfer of a transaction.
- When RVALID and RCHUNKV are asserted, RCHUNKNUM must be between zero and ARLEN.
- When RVALID and RCHUNKV are asserted, RCHUNKSTRB must not be zero.
- When RVALID and RCHUNKV are asserted, RLAST must only be asserted for the final response transfer of the transaction, irrespective of RCHUNKNUM and RCHUNKSTRB.
- When RVALID is asserted and RCHUNKV is deasserted, RCHUNKNUM and RCHUNKSTRB can take any value.

The number of data chunks transferred must be consistent with ARLEN and ARSIZE, so the number of bytes transferred in a transaction is the same whether chunking is enabled or not. Note that when using read data chunking, a transaction might have more read data transfers than indicated by ARLEN.

For unaligned transactions, chunks at addresses lower than ARADDR are not transferred and must have RCHUNKSTRB deasserted.

## **A5.6.2.3 Interoperability**

If a Manager supports read data chunking, then downstream interconnect and Subordinates can reduce their buffering if they also support chunking. An interconnect which connects to components with a mixture of chunking support can drive ARCHUNKEN and RCHUNKV according to the capabilities of the attached components.

When connecting interfaces with different values for the Read\_Data\_Chunking property, the following rules apply as shown in Table [A5.13.](#page-103-0)

### **A5.6.2.4 Chunking examples**

In these examples, each row in the figure represents a transfer and the shaded cells indicate bytes that are not transferred.

[Figure](#page-104-0) [A5.2](#page-104-0) shows a transaction on a 256-bit width read data channel where:

- Addr is 0x00.
- Length is 2 transfers.
- Size is 256 bits.
- Burst is INCR.

**Figure A5.2: Example of read data returned in 128-bit chunks**

[Figure](#page-104-1) [A5.3](#page-104-1) shows a transaction on a 256-bit width read data channel, where:

- Addr is 0x10.
- Length is 2 transfers.
- Size is 256 bits.
- Burst is INCR.

**Figure A5.3: Example with an unaligned address and a mixture of 128-bit and 256-bit chunks**

[Figure](#page-105-0) [A5.4](#page-105-0) shows a transaction on a 128-bit width read data channel, where:

- Addr is 0x10.
- Length is 4 transfers.
- Size is 128 bits.
- Burst is WRAP.
- RCHUNKSTRB is not present.

The Subordinate uses the start address as a hint and sends the chunk at 0x10 first.
