# <span id="page-66-0"></span>**A4.1 Subordinate types**

Subordinates are classified as either a Memory Subordinate or a Peripheral Subordinate.

### *Memory Subordinate*

A Memory Subordinate is required to handle all transaction types correctly.

### *Peripheral Subordinate*

A Peripheral Subordinate has an IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED method of access. Typically, the method of access is defined in the component data sheet that describes the transaction types that the Subordinate handles correctly.

<span id="page-66-1"></span>Any access to the Peripheral Subordinate that is not part of the IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED method of access must complete, in compliance with the protocol. However, when such an access has been made, there is no requirement that the Peripheral Subordinate continues to operate correctly. The Subordinate is only required to continue to complete further transactions in a protocol compliant manner.

# <span id="page-67-0"></span>**A4.2 Memory attributes**

This section describes the attributes that determine how a request should be treated by system components such as caches, buffers, and memory controllers.

The AWCACHE and ARCACHE signals specify the memory attributes of a request. They control:

- How a transaction progresses through the system.
- How any system-level buffers and caches handle the transaction.

<span id="page-67-2"></span>In this specification, the term AxCACHE refers collectively to the AWCACHE and ARCACHE signals. [Table](#page-67-2) [A4.1](#page-67-2) describes the AWCACHE and ARCACHE signals.

**Table A4.1: AxCACHE signals**

<span id="page-67-4"></span><span id="page-67-3"></span>

| Name                | Width | Default | Description                                                                                                                                     |
|---------------------|-------|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| AWCACHE,<br>ARCACHE | 4     | 0x0     | The memory attributes of a request control how a<br>transaction progresses through the system and how<br>caches and buffers handle the request. |

The CACHE\_Present property is used to determine if the AxCACHE signals are present on an interface.

**Table A4.2: CACHE\_Present property**

| CACHE_Present | Default | Description                             |
|---------------|---------|-----------------------------------------|
| True          | Y       | AWCACHE and ARCACHE are present.        |
| False         |         | AWCACHE and ARCACHE are not<br>present. |

AWCACHE bits are encoded as:

- [0] Bufferable
- [1] Modifiable
- [2] Other Allocate
- [3] Allocate

ARCACHE bits are encoded as:

- [0] Bufferable
- [1] Modifiable
- [2] Allocate
- [3] Other Allocate

Note that the Allocate and Other Allocate bits are in different positions for read and write requests.

### <span id="page-67-5"></span><span id="page-67-1"></span>**A4.2.1 Bufferable, AxCACHE[0]**

For write transactions:

- If the Bufferable bit is deasserted and AWCACHE[3:2] are both deasserted, the write response indicates that the data has reached its final destination.
- If the Bufferable bit is asserted, the write response can be sent from an intermediate point, when the observability requirements have been met.

For read transactions where ARCACHE[3:2] are deasserted (Non-cacheable) and ARCACHE[1] is asserted (Modifiable):

- If the Bufferable bit is deasserted, the read data must be obtained from the final destination.
- If the Bufferable bit is asserted, the read data can be obtained from the final destination or from a write that is progressing to the final destination.

For other combinations of ARCACHE[3:1], the Bufferable bit has no effect.

# <span id="page-68-0"></span>**A4.2.2 Modifiable, AxCACHE[1]**

When AxCACHE[1] is asserted, the transaction is Modifiable which indicates that the characteristics of the transaction can be modified. When AxCACHE[1] is deasserted, the transaction is Non-modifiable.

<span id="page-68-2"></span>The following sections describe the properties of Non-modifiable and Modifiable transactions.

#### *Non-modifiable transactions*

A Non-modifiable transaction must not be split into multiple transactions or merged with other transactions.

<span id="page-68-1"></span>In a Non-modifiable transaction, the parameters that are shown in [Table](#page-68-1) [A4.3](#page-68-1) must not be changed.

**Table A4.3: Parameters fixed as Non-modifiable**

| Parameter             | Signals                              |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Address               | AxADDR, and therefore AxREGION       |
| Size                  | AxSIZE                               |
| Length                | AxLEN                                |
| Burst type            | AxBURST                              |
| Protection attributes | AxPROT, AxNSE, AxPAS, AxINST, AxPRIV |

The AxCACHE attribute can only be modified to convert a transaction from being Bufferable to Non-bufferable. No other change to AxCACHE is permitted.

The transaction ID and the QoS values can be modified.

A Non-modifiable transaction with Length greater than 16 can be split into multiple transactions. Each resulting transaction must meet the requirements that are given in this subsection, except that:

- The Length is reduced.
- The address of the generated transactions is adapted appropriately.

A Non-modifiable transaction that is an exclusive access, as indicated by AxLOCK asserted, is permitted to have the Size, AxSIZE, and Length, AxLEN, modified if the total number of bytes accessed remains the same.

There are circumstances where it is not possible to meet the requirements of Non-modifiable transactions. For example, when downsizing to a data width narrower than required by Size, the transaction must be modified.

A component that performs such an operation can optionally include an IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED mechanism to indicate that a modification has occurred. This mechanism can assist with software debug.

### <span id="page-68-3"></span>*Modifiable transactions*

A Modifiable transaction can be modified in the following ways:

- A transaction can be broken into multiple transactions.
- Multiple transactions can be merged into a single transaction.

- A read transaction can fetch more data than required.
- A write transaction can access a larger address range than required using the WSTRB signals to ensure that only the appropriate locations are updated.
- In each generated transaction, the following attributes can be modified:
  - Address, AxADDR
  - Size, AxSIZE
  - Length, AxLEN
  - Burst type, AxBURST

The following must not be changed:

- Exclusive access indicator: AxLOCK
- The access and address space attributes: AxPROT, AxINST, AxPRIV, AxNSE, AxPAS, AxMMUPASUNKNOWN.

AxCACHE can be modified, but any modification must ensure that the visibility of transactions by other components is not reduced, either by preventing propagation of transactions to the required point, or by changing the need to look up a transaction in a cache. Any modification to the memory attributes must be consistent for all transactions to the same address range.

The transaction ID and QoS values can be modified.

No transaction modification is permitted that:

- Causes accesses to a different 4KB address space than that of the original transaction.
- Causes a single access to a single-copy atomicity sized region to be performed as multiple accesses. See [A6.1](#page-107-0) *[Single-copy atomicity size](#page-107-0)*.

### <span id="page-69-0"></span>**A4.2.3 Allocate and Other Allocate, AxCACHE[2], and AxCACHE[3]**

If the Allocate bit is asserted:

- The data might have been previously allocated, so the line must be looked up in a cache.
- It is recommended that the data is allocated into a cache for future use.

If the Other Allocate bit is asserted:

- The data might have been previously allocated, so the line must be looked up in a cache.
- It is not recommended that the data is allocated as it is not expected to be accessed again.

If Allocate and Other Allocate are both deasserted, the request is not required to look up in any cache.

# <span id="page-70-2"></span><span id="page-70-0"></span>**A4.3 Memory types**

The combination of AxCACHE signals indicates a memory type. [Table](#page-70-2) [A4.4](#page-70-2) shows the memory type encodings. Values in brackets are permitted but not preferred. Values that are not shown in the table are reserved.

**Table A4.4: Memory type encoding**

| ARCACHE[3:0]    | AWCACHE[3:0]    | Memory type                           |

## <span id="page-70-1"></span>**A4.3.1 Memory type requirements**

This section specifies the required behavior for each of the memory types.

### *Device Non-bufferable*

The required behavior for Device Non-bufferable memory is:

- The write response must be obtained from the final destination.
- Read data must be obtained from the final destination.
- Transactions are Non-modifiable, see [A4.2.2](#page-68-2) *[Non-modifiable transactions](#page-68-2)*.
- Read data must not be prefetched.
- Write transactions must not be merged.

### <span id="page-70-3"></span>*Device Bufferable*

The required behavior for the Device Bufferable memory type is:

- The write response can be obtained from an intermediate point.
- Write transactions must be made visible at the final destination *[in a timely manner](#page-315-2)*.
- Read data must be obtained from the final destination.
- Transactions are Non-modifiable, see [A4.2.2](#page-68-2) *[Non-modifiable transactions](#page-68-2)*.
- Read data must not be prefetched.
- Write transactions must not be merged.

Both Device memory types are Non-modifiable. In this specification, the terms Device memory and Non-modifiable memory are interchangeable.

For read transactions, there is no difference in the required behavior for Device Non-bufferable and Device Bufferable memory types.

### *Normal Non-cacheable Non-bufferable*

The required behavior for the Normal Non-cacheable Non-bufferable memory type is:

- The write response must be obtained from the final destination.
- Read data must be obtained from the final destination.
- Transactions are Modifiable, see [A4.2.2](#page-68-3) *[Modifiable transactions](#page-68-3)*.
- Write transactions can be merged.

### <span id="page-71-0"></span>*Normal Non-cacheable Bufferable*

The required behavior for the Normal Non-cacheable Bufferable memory type is:

- The write response can be obtained from an intermediate point.
- Write transactions must be made visible at the final destination *[in a timely manner](#page-315-2)*, as defined in the glossary. There is no mechanism to determine when a write transaction is visible at its final destination.
- Read data must be obtained from either:
  - The final destination.
  - A write transaction that is progressing to its final destination.
- If read data is obtained from a write transaction:
  - It must be obtained from the most recent version of the write.
  - The data must not be cached to service a later read.
- Transactions are Modifiable, see [A4.2.2](#page-68-3) *[Modifiable transactions](#page-68-3)*.
- Write transactions can be merged.

For a Normal Non-cacheable Bufferable read, data can be obtained from a write transaction that is still progressing to its final destination. This data is indistinguishable from the read and write transactions propagating to arrive at the final destination at the same time. Read data that is returned in this manner does not indicate that the write transaction is visible at the final destination.

#### <span id="page-71-1"></span>*Write-Through No-Allocate*

The required behavior for the Write-Through No-Allocate memory type is:

- The write response can be obtained from an intermediate point.
- Write transactions must be made visible at the final destination *[in a timely manner](#page-315-2)*, as defined in the glossary. There is no mechanism to determine when a write transaction is visible at the final destination.
- Read data can be obtained from an intermediately cached copy.
- Transactions are Modifiable, see [A4.2.2](#page-68-3) *[Modifiable transactions](#page-68-3)*.
- Read data can be prefetched.
- Write transactions can be merged.
- A cache lookup is required for read and write transactions.
- The No-Allocate attribute is an allocation hint, that is, it is a recommendation to the memory system that for performance reasons, these transactions are not allocated. However, the allocation of read and write transactions is not prohibited.

#### *Write-Through Read-Allocate*

The required behavior for the Write-Through Read-Allocate memory type is the same as for Write-Through No-Allocate memory. For performance reasons:

- Allocation of read transactions is recommended.
- Allocation of write transactions is not recommended.

#### *Write-Through Write-Allocate*

The required behavior for the Write-Through Write-Allocate memory type is the same as for Write-Through No-Allocate memory. For performance reasons:

- Allocation of read transactions is not recommended.
- Allocation of write transactions is recommended.

#### *Write-Through Read and Write-Allocate*

The required behavior for the Write-Through Read and Write-Allocate memory type is the same as for Write-Through No-Allocate memory. For performance reasons:

- Allocation of read transactions is recommended.
- Allocation of write transactions is recommended.

#### *Write-Back No-Allocate*

The required behavior for the Write-Back No-Allocate memory type is:

- The write response can be obtained from an intermediate point.
- Write transactions are not required to be made visible at the final destination.
- Read data can be obtained from an intermediately cached copy.
- Transactions are Modifiable, see [A4.2.2](#page-68-3) *[Modifiable transactions](#page-68-3)*.
- Read data can be prefetched.
- Write transactions can be merged.
- A cache lookup is required for read and write transactions.
- The No-Allocate attribute is an allocation hint, that is, it is a recommendation to the memory system that for performance reasons, these transactions are not allocated. However, the allocation of read and write transactions is not prohibited.

### *Write-Back Read-Allocate*

The required behavior for the Write-Back Read-Allocate memory type is the same as for Write-Back No-Allocate memory. For performance reasons:

- Allocation of read transactions is recommended.
- Allocation of write transactions is not recommended.

#### *Write-Back Write-Allocate*

The required behavior for the Write-Back Write-Allocate memory type is the same as for Write-Back No-Allocate memory. For performance reasons:

- Allocation of read transactions is not recommended.
- Allocation of write transactions is recommended.

#### *Write-Back Read and Write-Allocate*

The required behavior for the Write-Back Read and Write-Allocate memory type is the same as for Write-Back No-Allocate memory. For performance reasons:

- Allocation of read transactions is recommended.
- Allocation of write transactions is recommended.

### <span id="page-73-0"></span>**A4.3.2 Mismatched memory attributes**

Multiple agents that are accessing the same area of memory, can use mismatched memory attributes. However, for functional correctness, the following rules must be obeyed:

- All Managers accessing the same area of memory must have a consistent view of the cacheability of that area of memory at any level of hierarchy. The rules to be applied are:
  - If the address region is Non-cacheable, all Managers must use transactions with both AxCACHE[3:2] deasserted.
  - If the address region is Cacheable, all Managers must use transactions with either of AxCACHE[3:2] asserted.
- Different Managers can use different allocation hints.
- If an addressed region is Normal Non-cacheable, any Manager can access it using a Device memory transaction.
- If an addressed region has the Bufferable attribute, any Manager can access it using transactions that do not permit Bufferable behavior. For example, a transaction that requires the response from the final destination does not permit Bufferable behavior.

# <span id="page-73-1"></span>**A4.3.3 Changing memory attributes**

The attributes for a particular memory region can be changed from one type to another incompatible type. For example, the attribute can be changed from Write-Through Cacheable to Normal Non-cacheable. This change requires a suitable process to perform the change.

Typically, the following process is performed:

- 1. All Managers stop accessing the region.
- 2. A single Manager performs any required cache maintenance operations.
- 3. All Managers restart accessing the memory region, using the new attributes.

### <span id="page-73-2"></span>**A4.3.4 Transaction buffering**

Write access to the following memory types do not require a transaction response from the final destination, but do require that write transactions are made visible at the final destination *[in a timely manner](#page-315-2)*:

- Device Bufferable
- Normal Non-cacheable Bufferable
- Write-Through

For write transactions, all three memory types require the same behavior.

For read transactions, the required behavior is as follows:

- For Device Bufferable memory, read data must be obtained from the final destination.
- For Normal Non-cacheable Bufferable memory, read data must be obtained either from the final destination or from a write transaction that is progressing to its final destination.

• For Write-Through memory, read data can be obtained from an intermediately cached copy.

In addition to ensuring that write transactions progress towards their final destination *[in a timely manner](#page-315-2)*, intermediate buffers must behave as follows:

• An intermediate buffer that can respond to a transaction must ensure that over time, any read transaction to Normal Non-cacheable Bufferable propagates towards its destination. This propagation means that when forwarding a read transaction, the attempted forwarding must not continue indefinitely, and any data that is used for forwarding must not persist indefinitely. The protocol does not define a mechanism to determine the duration for which data used in forwarding a read transaction, can be retained. However, in such a mechanism, the act of reading the data must not reset the data timeout period.

Without this requirement, continued polling of the same location can prevent the timeout of a read that is held in the buffer, preventing the read progressing towards its destination.

• An intermediate buffer that can hold and merge write transactions must ensure that transactions do not remain in its buffer indefinitely. For example, merging write transactions must not reset the mechanism that determines when a write is drained towards its final destination.

Without this requirement, continued writes to the same location can prevent the timeout of a write held in the buffer, preventing the write progressing towards its destination.

For information about the required behavior of read accesses to these memory types, see:

- [A4.3.1](#page-70-3) *[Device Bufferable](#page-70-3)*
- [A4.3.1](#page-71-0) *[Normal Non-cacheable Bufferable](#page-71-0)*
- [A4.3.1](#page-71-1) *[Write-Through No-Allocate](#page-71-1)*

### <span id="page-74-0"></span>**A4.3.5 Example use of Device memory types**

The specification supports the combined use of Device Non-bufferable and Device Bufferable memory types to force write transactions to reach their final destination and ensure that the issuing Manager knows when the transaction is visible to all other Managers.

A write transaction that is marked as Device Bufferable is required to reach its final destination *[in a timely manner](#page-315-2)*. However, the write response for the transaction can be signaled by an intermediate buffer. Therefore, the issuing Manager cannot know when the write is visible to all other Managers.

If a Manager issues a Device Bufferable write transaction, or stream of write transactions, followed by a Device Non-bufferable write transaction, and all transactions use the same AXI ID, then the AXI ordering requirements force all of the Device Bufferable write transactions to reach the final destination before a response is given to the Device Non-bufferable transaction. Therefore, the response to the Device Non-bufferable transaction indicates that all the transactions are visible to all Managers.

A Device Non-bufferable transaction can only guarantee the completion of Device Bufferable transactions that are issued with the same ID, and are to the same Subordinate device.

# <span id="page-75-0"></span>**A4.4 Protocol errors**

The AXI protocol defines two categories of protocol errors, a software protocol error and a hardware protocol error.

### <span id="page-75-1"></span>**A4.4.1 Software protocol error**

A software protocol error occurs when multiple accesses to the same location are made with mismatched shareability or cacheability attributes. A software protocol error can cause a loss of coherency and result in the corruption of data values. The protocol requires that the system does not deadlock for a software protocol error, and that transactions always progress through a system.

A software protocol error for an access in one 4KB memory region must not cause data corruption in a different 4KB memory region. For locations held in Normal memory, the use of appropriate software barriers and cache maintenance can be used to return memory locations to a defined state.

When accessing a peripheral device, if Modifiable transactions are used (AxCACHE[1] is asserted), then the correct operation of the peripheral cannot be guaranteed. The only requirement is that the peripheral continues to respond to transactions in a protocol compliant manner. To restore a peripheral device that has been accessed incorrectly, to a known operational state, involves a sequence of events that are IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED.

### <span id="page-75-2"></span>**A4.4.2 Hardware protocol error**

A hardware protocol error is defined as any protocol error that is not a software protocol error. No support is required for hardware protocol errors.

<span id="page-75-3"></span>If a hardware protocol error occurs, then recovery from the error is not guaranteed. The system might crash, lock up, or suffer some other non-recoverable failure.

# <span id="page-76-14"></span><span id="page-76-0"></span>**A4.5 Protection attributes**

AXI requests can have attributes that can be used to protect memory from unexpected accesses. These attributes are physical address space (PAS), Privileged, and Instruction.

### <span id="page-76-2"></span><span id="page-76-1"></span>**A4.5.1 Signaling for protection attributes**

[Table](#page-76-2) [A4.5](#page-76-2) shows the signals that can be used to indicate protection attributes.

AxPROT and AxNSE signals have been superseded by AxPRIV, AxINST and AxPAS for signaling protection attributes. An interface must not include both sets of signals, the following rules apply:

- If PROT\_Present is True, PAS\_WIDTH must be 0.
- If PROT\_Present is True, INSTPRIV\_Present must be False.

### <span id="page-77-0"></span>**A4.5.2 Privileged and Instruction attributes**

An AXI Manager might support more than one level of operating privilege, and can optionally extend this concept of privilege to memory access. Some processors support multiple levels of privilege, see the documentation for the selected processor to determine the mapping to AXI privilege levels. The only distinction AXI can provide is between privileged and unprivileged access.

Access privilege can be signaled using either AxPROT[0] or AxPRIV:

- 0b0: Unprivileged
- 0b1: Privileged

An access can be labeled as an instruction access or a data access, using either AxPROT[2] or AxINST:

- 0b0: Data access
- 0b1: Instruction access

The AXI protocol defines this indication as a hint. It is not accurate in all cases, for example, where a transaction contains a mix of instruction and data items. It is recommended that a Manager indicates a data access unless the access is known to be an instruction access.

### <span id="page-78-0"></span>**A4.5.3 Physical address space (PAS)**

An AXI request can include a physical address space identifier. Requests with the same address but to different physical address spaces can decode to different memory locations. Some memory locations might have access restrictions based on the PAS.

<span id="page-78-3"></span>[Table](#page-78-3) [A4.7](#page-78-3) shows the physical address spaces with signal encodings and property that must be True to enable a Manager to use that encoding. An interface can include AxPAS or AxPROT/AxNSE signals, not both.

**Table A4.7: Physical address space encodings**

| Physical address space     | AxPAS | AxPROT[1] | AxNSE | Property    |
|----------------------------|-------|-----------|-------|-------------|
| Secure                     | 0b000 | 0b0       | 0b0   | -           |

Other values of AxPAS are reserved.

### <span id="page-78-1"></span>**A4.5.4 Realm Management Extension**

Memory protection can be extended using the Realm Management Extension (RME) [\[3\]](#page-16-3). This provides hardware-based isolation that allows execution contexts to run in different Security states and share resources in the system.

When RME is used, it adds the Root and Realm physical address spaces, affects the operation of [cache](#page-166-1) [maintenance operations](#page-166-1) and extends the [MPAM](#page-185-1) signals.

RME support is defined using the RME\_Support property.

**Table A4.8: RME\_Support property**

| RME_Support | Default | Description           |
|-------------|---------|-----------------------|
| True        |         | RME is supported.     |
| False       | Y       | RME is not supported. |

### <span id="page-78-2"></span>**A4.5.5 Granular Data Isolation**

*Granular Data Isolation* (GDI) is an extension to the Arm *Realm Management Extension* (RME).

The GDI feature is designed to enable memory isolation between data flows from *Processing Elements* (PEs) and non-Processing Elements, within an RME system. To achieve this, two physical address spaces (PAS) are defined for specific use cases:

- Non-secure Protected (NSP)
  - Intended for media pipelines, with flexible Non-secure software management and strong data confidentiality.
  - Memory is managed by a *Processing Element* (PE), using the SMMU, on behalf of a Non-secure device in protected mode.

- System Agent (SA)
  - Intended for use by higher security on chip sub-systems that require memory allocation on request.
  - Fully isolated from PEs, and any additional memory management is independent from the PEs.
  - Requests to the System Agent PAS are physically addressed but might require access checks.

PEs are not permitted to directly access either of these new PAS, except for performing Cache Maintenance through to the *Point of Physical Aliasing* (PoPA).

Both new physical address spaces are permitted to make use of the RME Memory Encryption Contexts (MEC) feature, see [A4.6](#page-80-0) *[Memory Encryption Contexts](#page-80-0)*.

For more information on the GDI architecture, see [\[3\]](#page-16-3).

See [Table](#page-78-3) [A4.7](#page-78-3) for the NSP and SA physical address space encodings.

The property GDI\_Support determines whether an interface supports Granular Data Isolation.

**Table A4.9: GDI\_Support property**

| GDI_Support | Default | Description                                                 |  |
|-------------|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------|--|
| True        |         | GDI is supported. NSP and SA address spaces can<br>be used. |  |
| False       | Y       | GDI is not supported.                                       |  |

The following rules apply to the GDI\_Support property:

- When RME\_Support is False, GDI\_Support must be False.
- When GDI\_Support is True, PAS\_WIDTH must be 3.
- <span id="page-79-0"></span>• When GDI\_Support is True, Untranslated\_Transactions must be False or v4.

# <span id="page-80-0"></span>**A4.6 Memory Encryption Contexts**

*Memory Encryption Contexts* (MEC) is an extension to the Arm *Realm Management Extension* (RME) that allows each Realm to have its own unique encryption context. The MEC extension assigns memory encryption contexts to all memory accesses within the Realm physical address space. All memory transactions are associated with a MECID, which is determined by the Security state, translation regime, translation tables and the MEC system registers. The MECID is used by a memory encryption engine as an index into a table of encryption contexts, either keys or tweaks, that contribute to the external memory encryption.

Use of MEC can help protect Realm data in memory, by enabling each set of Realm data to be encrypted in a different way. This means that a malicious agent that has access to the physical memory device and is able to decipher one set of Realm data, cannot use the same decryption method to access other sets of Realm data. Before the *Point of Encryption* (PoE) the data that moves between components is in plaintext form.

Realm management software at R-EL2 controls MECID policy and assignment to Realms.

For more information on MEC, see [\[3\]](#page-16-3) and [\[4\]](#page-16-4).

Note that the MEC architecture specification [\[3\]](#page-16-3) details several implementation options for when a MECID value mismatch occurs. This MEC implementation assumes that Managers and caches do not perform any MECID checks. For example, if a read access associated with a MECID targets a location that has a copy present in a cache and is associated with a different MECID, the read access succeeds as though the MECID values did not mismatch. Additional protection is not needed here as Realm management software at R-EL2 ensures that one context can be prevented from accessing locations that belong to a different context, thus ensuring plaintext leakages do not occur.

### <span id="page-80-4"></span><span id="page-80-1"></span>**A4.6.1 MEC signaling**

The MEC\_Support property determines whether an interface supports Memory Encryption Contexts.

**Table A4.10: MEC\_Support property**

| MEC_Support | Default | Description                                               |
|-------------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| True        |         | MEC is supported, AxMECID signals are present.            |
| False       | Y       | MEC is not supported, AxMECID signals are not<br>present. |

MEC is an extension of RME, so if the RME\_Support property is False, MEC\_Support must be False.

The following signals are required to support MEC.

**Table A4.11: MECID signals**

<span id="page-80-3"></span><span id="page-80-2"></span>

| Name                | Width       | Default   | Description                                          |
|---------------------|-------------|-----------|------------------------------------------------------|
| AWMECID,<br>ARMECID | MECID_WIDTH | All zeros | RME Memory Encryption Context identifier<br>(MECID). |

The parameter MECID\_WIDTH defines the width of the AxMECID signals.

**Table A4.12: MECID\_WIDTH property**

| Name        | Values | Default | Description                           |
|-------------|--------|---------|---------------------------------------|
| MECID_WIDTH | 0, 16  | 0       | Width of AWMECID and ARMECID in bits. |

The following rules apply to the MECID\_WIDTH property:

- If MECID\_WIDTH is 0, AWMECID and ARMECID are not present on the interface.
- If MEC\_Support is False, MECID\_WIDTH must be 0.
- If MEC\_Support is True, MECID\_WIDTH must not be 0.

Note that the width of MECID does not indicate how many different values are used by a component. It might be possible to reduce the storage requirements of MECID by using a narrower internal width.

<span id="page-81-1"></span>The compatibility between Manager and Subordinate interfaces according to the values of the MEC\_Support property is shown in Table [A4.13.](#page-81-1)

**Table A4.13: MEC\_Support compatibility**

| MEC_Support    | Subordinate: False                                              | Subordinate: True                           |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|

| Manager: True  | Compatible.<br>Downstream memory is not encrypted<br>using MEC. | Compatible.                                 |

### <span id="page-81-0"></span>**A4.6.2 MECID usage**

The MECID value range is bounded, dependent on the physical address space being accessed.

**Table A4.14: MECID constraints**

| Physical address space | MECID constraints   |
|------------------------|---------------------|
| Secure                 | Must be zero        |
| Non-secure             | Must be zero        |
| Root                   | Must be zero        |
| Realm                  | Can take any valuea |
| System Agent           | Can take any valuea |
| Non-Secure Protected   | Can take any valuea |

<sup>a</sup> Depends on the MEC\_Support and MECID\_Width properties.

MECID is inapplicable and can take any value for the following request Opcodes:

- CMO
- CleanInvalid

#### *Chapter A4. Request attributes A4.6. Memory Encryption Contexts*

- MakeInvalid
- CleanShared
- CleanSharedPersist
- InvalidateHint
- StashTranslation
- UnstashTranslation

MECID is inapplicable and must be 0 for the following request Opcodes:

• DVM Complete

Components that propagate transactions and support MECID on their Subordinate and Manager interfaces must preserve the MECID on requests where it is applicable. Components that perform address translation might change the MECID.

A cache that stores data which has an associated MECID must also store the MECID and provide it with the data during a write-back.

A CleanInvalidPoPA operation can be used to ensure that a cache line is cleaned and invalidated from all caches upstream of the Point of Encryption. See [A9.9](#page-167-0) *[Cache maintenance and Realm Management Extension](#page-167-0)* for more information on CleanInvalidPoPA.

### <span id="page-82-0"></span>**A4.6.3 MEC and GDI**

When using MEC and GDI, MECID must be valid for all accesses to Non-secure Protected or System Agent physical address spaces. MECID mismatches must not result in a loss of confidentiality of data between Memory Encryption Contexts.

A cache must enforce the following rules for the System Agent and Non-secure Protected physical address spaces when there is a difference between the incoming request MECID and the previously cached MECID value.

- For a read transaction:
  - Any returned data must be masked to an IMPLEMENTATION SPECIFIC value. Arm recommends, but does not require, that this value is all ones.
  - The cache is permitted to retain the line.
- For a partial write transaction:
  - Cached data must be masked to an IMPLEMENTATION SPECIFIC value. Arm recommends, but does not require, that this value is all ones.
  - The partial write data is then merged into this masked value.
  - The cached MECID for the location must be updated to the MECID of the incoming write.
- For a full cache line write transaction:
  - The write data overwrites the previously cached value.
  - The cached MECID must be updated to the MECID of the incoming write.

For more information on GDI, see [A4.5.5](#page-78-2) *[Granular Data Isolation](#page-78-2)*.

# <span id="page-83-0"></span>**A4.7 Multiple region interfaces**

This section describes the use of a region identifier with a request, to support interfaces with multiple address regions within a single interface.

## <span id="page-83-1"></span>**A4.7.1 Region identifier signaling**

The property REGION\_Present determines whether an interface supports region identifier signaling.

**Table A4.15: REGION\_Present property**

| REGION_Present | Default | Description                               |
|----------------|---------|-------------------------------------------|
| True           | Y       | AWREGION and ARREGION are present.        |
| False          |         | AWREGION and ARREGION are not<br>present. |

<span id="page-83-3"></span>The signals to indicate a region are shown in Table [A4.16.](#page-83-3)

**Table A4.16: Region signals**

<span id="page-83-5"></span><span id="page-83-4"></span>

| Name                  | Width | Default | Description                                                                           |
|-----------------------|-------|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| AWREGION,<br>ARREGION | 4     | 0x0     | A 4-bit region identifier which can be used to<br>identify different address regions. |

### <span id="page-83-2"></span>**A4.7.2 Using the region identifier**

The 4-bit region identifier can be used to uniquely identify up to 16 different regions. The region identifier can provide a decode of higher-order address bits. The region identifier must remain constant within any 4K-byte address space.

The use of region identifiers means that a single physical interface on a Subordinate can provide multiple logical interfaces, each with a different location in the system address map. The use of the region identifier means that the Subordinate does not have to support the address decode between the different logical interfaces.

This specification expects an interconnect to produce AxREGION signals when performing the address decode function for a single Subordinate that has multiple logical interfaces. If a Subordinate only has a single physical interface in the system address map, the interconnect must use the default AxREGION values.

There are several usage models for the region identifier including, but not limited to, the following:

- A peripheral can have its main data path and control registers at different locations in the address map, and be accessed through a single interface without the need for the Subordinate to perform an address decode.
- A Subordinate can exhibit different behaviors in different memory regions. For example, a Subordinate might provide read and write access in one region, but read-only access in another region.

A Subordinate must ensure that the correct protocol signaling and the correct ordering of transactions are maintained. A Subordinate must ensure that it provides the responses to two requests to different regions with the same transaction ID in the correct order.

A Subordinate must also ensure the correct protocol signaling for any values of AxREGION. If a Subordinate implements fewer than sixteen regions, then the Subordinate must ensure the correct protocol signaling on any attempted access to an unsupported region. How this is achieved is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED. For example, the Subordinate might ensure this by:

#### *Chapter A4. Request attributes A4.7. Multiple region interfaces*

- Providing an error response for any transaction that accesses an unsupported region.
- Aliasing supported regions across all unsupported regions, to ensure that a protocol compliant response is given for all accesses.

The AxREGION signals only provide an address decode of the existing address space that can be used by Subordinates to remove the need for an address decode function. The signals do not create new independent address spaces. AxREGION must only be present on an interface that is downstream of an address decode function.

# <span id="page-85-0"></span>**A4.8 QoS signaling**

AXI supports Quality of Service (QoS) schemes through the features of:

- [A4.8.1](#page-85-1) *[QoS identifiers](#page-85-1)*
- [A4.8.2](#page-86-0) *[QoS acceptance indicators](#page-86-0)*

## <span id="page-85-2"></span><span id="page-85-1"></span>**A4.8.1 QoS identifiers**

An AXI request has an optional identifier which can be used to distinguish between different traffic streams as shown in Table [A4.17.](#page-85-2)

**Table A4.17: QoS signals**

<span id="page-85-4"></span><span id="page-85-3"></span>

| Name            | Width | Default | Description                                                                             |
|-----------------|-------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| AWQOS,<br>ARQOS | 4     | 0x0     | Quality of Service identifier used to distinguish<br>between different traffic streams. |

The QOS\_Present property is used to define whether an interface includes the AxQOS signals.

**Table A4.18: QOS\_Present property**

| QOS_Present | Default | Description                      |
|-------------|---------|----------------------------------|
| True        | Y       | AWQOS and ARQOS are present.     |
| False       |         | AWQOS and ARQOS are not present. |

The protocol does not specify the exact use of the QoS identifier. It is recommended to use AxQOS as a priority indicator for the associated write or read request, where a higher value indicates a higher priority request.

#### *Using the QoS identifiers*

A Manager can produce its own AxQOS values, and if it can produce multiple streams of traffic, it can choose different QoS values for the different streams.

Support for QoS requires a system-level understanding of the QoS scheme in use, and collaboration between all participating components. For this reason, it is recommended that a Manager component includes some programmability that can be used to control the exact QoS values that are used for any given scenario.

If a Manager component does not support a programmable QoS scheme, it can use QoS values that represent the relative priorities of the transactions it generates. These values can then be mapped to alternative system level QoS values if appropriate.

This specification expects that many interconnect component implementations will support programmable registers that can be used to assign QoS values to connected Managers. These values replace the QoS values, either programmed or default, supplied by the Managers.

The default system-level implementation of QoS is that any component with a choice of more than one transaction to process selects the request with the higher QoS value to process first. This selection only occurs when there is no other AXI constraint that requires the requests to be processed in a particular order. This means that the AXI ordering rules take precedence over ordering for QoS purposes.

### <span id="page-86-0"></span>**A4.8.2 QoS acceptance indicators**

The QoS acceptance indicators as shown in Table [A4.19](#page-86-1) are output signals from a Subordinate interface that indicate the minimum QoS value it will accept without delay.

<span id="page-86-1"></span>The signals are synchronous to ACLK but are unrelated to any other AXI channel.

**Table A4.19: QoS acceptance signals**

<span id="page-86-3"></span><span id="page-86-2"></span>

| Name         | Width | Default | Description                                                                                                        |
|--------------|-------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| VAWQOSACCEPT | 4     | 0x0     | An output from a Subordinate that indicates the<br>QoS value for which it accepts requests from the<br>AW channel. |
| VARQOSACCEPT | 4     | 0x0     | An output from a Subordinate that indicates the<br>QoS value for which it accepts requests from the<br>AR channel. |

QoS Accept signaling is intended for Subordinate components that have different resources available for different QoS values, which is typically the case with memory controllers. The Subordinate can indicate that it only accepts requests at a certain QoS value or above when the resources available to lower QoS values are in use.

QoS Accept signaling can be used as an input to a Manager interface that might have several different requests to select from. This permits the Manager interface to only issue requests that are likely to be accepted, which avoids unnecessary blocking of the interface. By preventing the issue of requests that might be stalled for a significant period, the interface remains available for the issue of higher priority requests that might arrive at a later point in time.

In this specification, the term VAxQOSACCEPT refers collectively to the VAWQOSACCEPT and VARQOSACCEPT signals.

The rules and recommendations for the VAxQOSACCEPT signals are:

- Any requests with QoS level equal to or higher than VAxQOSACCEPT are accepted by the Subordinate.
- Any request with QoS level below VAxQOSACCEPT might be stalled for a significant time.
  - This specification does not define a time period during which the Subordinate is required to accept a request at, or above, the QoS level indicated. However, it is expected that for a given Subordinate there will be a deterministic maximum number of clock cycles taken to accept a transaction, after taking into account implementation aspects such as clock domain crossing ratios.
- It is permitted for a Subordinate interface to accept a request that is below the QoS level indicated by the VAxQOSACCEPT signal, but it is expected that the request might be subject to a significant delay.

While it is acceptable for a Subordinate to delay a request that has a lower priority than the QoS acceptance level, it is recommended that such a transaction is not delayed indefinitely.

There are several reasons for a lower-priority transaction to be issued on the interface, for example:

- A delay between a change in the QoS acceptance value and the ability of the component to adapt to that change.
- A requirement to make progress on a transaction that is Head-of-line blocking a higher priority request.
- A requirement to make progress on a transaction for reasons of starvation prevention.

The QoS\_Accept property as shown in Table [A4.20](#page-87-0) is used to define whether an interface includes the QoS accept indicator signals.

**Table A4.20: QoS\_Accept property**

<span id="page-87-0"></span>

| QoS_Accept | Default | Description                                                             |
|------------|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| True       |         | The interface includes VAWQOSACCEPT and<br>VARQOSACCEPT signals.        |
| False      | Y       | The interface does not include VAWQOSACCEPT<br>or VARQOSACCEPT signals. |
