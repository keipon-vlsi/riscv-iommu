# <span id="page-273-0"></span>Chapter B1 **Signal list**

This appendix lists all the signals described within this specification. Some channels and signals are optional, so are not included on every interface. Each signal name contains a hyperlink to the section in which the signal is defined.

Parity check signals are not included in this chapter but are listed in [A16.2.3](#page-266-0) *[Parity check signals](#page-266-0)*.

Signals are grouped based on channel and category as described in the following sections:

- [B1.1](#page-274-0) *[Write channels](#page-274-0)*
- [B1.2](#page-278-0) *[Read channels](#page-278-0)*
- [B1.3](#page-281-0) *[Snoop channels](#page-281-0)*
- [B1.4](#page-282-0) *[Interface level signals](#page-282-0)*

# <span id="page-274-0"></span>**B1.1 Write channels**

The write channels are used to transfer requests, data, and responses for write transactions and some other data-less transactions.

### <span id="page-274-1"></span>**B1.1.1 Write request channel**

The write request channel carries all the required address and control information for transactions that use the write channels. Signals on this channel have the prefix AW.

# <span id="page-282-0"></span>**B1.4 Interface level signals**

Interface level signals are non-channel signals. There can be up to one set of each per interface.

### <span id="page-282-1"></span>**B1.4.1 Clock and reset signals**

All signals on an interface are synchronous to a global clock and are reset using a global reset signal.

| Name    | Width | Source   | Description         |
|---------|-------|----------|---------------------|
| ACLK    | 1     | External | Global clock signal |
